🚀 We have launched the DrEval Challenge 🚀 :date:`2024-11-26`
--------------------------------------------------------------

| We think that it is possible to design a meaningful drug response prediction model that outperforms simple baseline models.
|
| The DrEval challenge is simple:
|
| 1. Integrate your model into DrEval by following the Contributor Guide.
| 2. Compare your model to the baseline models provided in the DrEval package, either using the standalone or the Nextflow pipeline.
| 3. Let us know your results!
|    3.1. 🎊If you significantly outperform the GradientBoosting baseline model, we will personally send you chocolate or another snack of your choosing 🍫.
|    3.2. 🥺If you perform significantly worse than the NaiveDrugMeanPredictor, you will have to send us chocolate.
