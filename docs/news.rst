🚀 We have launched the DrEval Challenge 🚀 :date:`2024-11-26`
--------------------------------------------------------------

| We think that it is possible to design a meaningful drug response prediction model that outperforms simple baseline models.
|
| The DrEval challenge is simple:
|
| 1. Integrate your model into DrEval by following the Contributor Guide.
| 2. Compare your model to the baseline models provided in the DrEval package, either using the standalone or the Nextflow pipeline.
| 3. Let us know your results!
|    3.1. 🎊If you significantly outperform the RandomForest baseline model in the LCO setting or the GradientBoosting model in the LDO setting, we will personally send you chocolate or another snack of your choosing 🍫.
|    3.2. 🥺If you perform significantly worse than the NaiveDrugMeanPredictor, you will have to send us chocolate.

📜 Origin Story 💊 :date:`2023-11-20`
--------------------------------------------------------------

    *Long ago, the people of science lived in harmony. Researchers collaborated, data flowed freely, and models were tested with integrity.
    But then, the H-Index Nation attacked.
    Suddenly, impact factors ruled all, flashy results overshadowed rigorous testing, and biased benchmarks spread like wildfire. Science, once a beacon of knowledge, became clouded by competition and questionable practices.
    Only a fair and unbiased framework could restore balance.
    And when the field needed it most—drevalpy was born.
    A framework designed to test drug response prediction models with fairness and transparency, cutting through bias and restoring the integrity of scientific evaluation.
    Though the fight against bad practices is long, with drevalpy, balance may yet be restored.*
