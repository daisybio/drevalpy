   :alt: Overview of the DrEval framework. Via input options, implemented state-of-the-art models can be compared against baselines of varying complexity. We address obstacles to progress in the field at each point in our pipeline: Our framework is available on PyPI and nf-core and we follow FAIReR standards for optimal reproducibility. DrEval is easily extendable as demonstrated here with an implementation of a proteomics-based random forest. Custom viability data can be preprocessed with CurveCurator, leading to more consistent data and metrics. DrEval supports five widely used datasets with application-aware train/test splits that enable detecting weak generalization. Models are free to use provided cell line- and drug features or custom ones. The pipeline supports randomization-based ablation studies and performs robust hyperparameter tuning for all models. Evaluation is conducted using meaningful, bias-resistant metrics to avoid inflated results from artifacts such as Simpson’s paradox. All results are compiled into an interactive HTML report.


Overview
=======

Focus on Innovating Your Models — DrEval Handles the Rest!
-  DrEval is a toolkit that ensures drug response prediction evaluations are statistically sound, biologically meaningful, and reproducible.
-  Focus on model innovation while using our automated standardized evaluation protocols and preprocessing workflows.
-  A flexible model interface supports all model types (e.g. Machine Learning, Stats, Network-based analyses)
